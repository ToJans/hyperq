[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/hyperq/hyperq.png)](http://travis-ci.org/hyperq/hyperq)

[Main Site](http://hyperq.github.io)

hyperq is a small project with a big ambition. We aim to build the worlds best
algorithmic trading platform using the best off-the-shelf open source
technology stack to be found.

## Build

```sh
$ # build the library and tests
$ cabal configure --enable-tests
$ cabal build
$ # run the benchmarks
$ cabal test
```

Beyond building the haskell code, the easiest way to
get up to speed is to read the project [blog](http://hyperq.github.io/blog). If
you're interested in contributing to development or find a logic bug, then
fork me with:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/hyperq/hyperq.git
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
```

A discussion group has been formed at [hft-discuss](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups#!forum/hft-discuss)

Some near-term goals include:
- moving the project to an organization basis (which will involve a name
  change (watch this space).
- installing a modern communication toolkit
- exploring automated deployment and build options
- discussing the relative strengths and weaknesses of python versus R, as they
  apply to the hft problem domain.
